# morning-milk
morning-milk is a CLI sprite exporter for NES ROMs. It dumps all CHR ROM data to 16x16 sprite sized sheets in grayscale
## Build
Do `make`. I used `stb_image_write.h` to write png
## Usage
```
morning-milk export [files]
```
`export` is here in case if I in future will be adding more funcitonality to this
